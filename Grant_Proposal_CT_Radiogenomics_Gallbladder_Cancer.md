## 1. Origin of the Proposal

### Background and Rationale

Gallbladder cancer (GBC) represents one of the most aggressive biliary tract malignancies, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 20% when diagnosed at advanced stages (Sharma et al., 2021). The geographic distribution of GBC shows significant variations, with higher incidence rates observed in South Asia, South America, and specific regions of Europe and North America. This heterogeneous distribution suggests complex interplays between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and molecular mechanisms driving tumorigenesis.

The current clinical paradigm for GBC management relies primarily on conventional imaging modalities, histopathological examination, and limited molecular profiling. However, these approaches often fail to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying genomic landscape that drives tumor behavior, treatment resistance, and patient outcomes. The advent of precision oncology has highlighted the critical need for non-invasive methodologies that can accurately predict genomic alterations and guide targeted therapeutic interventions.

### Unmet Clinical Need

Despite significant advances in cancer genomics, the translation of molecular insights into clinically actionable strategies for GBC remains challenging. Current limitations include:

1. **Tissue Accessibility**: Obtaining adequate tissue samples for comprehensive genomic profiling is often challenging due to the anatomical location and advanced stage at presentation
2. **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Spatial and temporal heterogeneity within GBC tumors limits the representativeness of single biopsy samples
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Traditional genomic profiling methods cannot provide dynamic assessment of tumor evolution during treatment
4. **Cost and Accessibility**: Comprehensive genomic sequencing remains expensive and not universally accessible across different healthcare settings

### Innovation Opportunity

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and radiogenomics have opened unprecedented opportunities to address these clinical challenges. Radiogenomics, the study of relationships between imaging features and genomic characteristics, has demonstrated remarkable potential in various cancer types including lung, breast, and glioblastoma. However, its application in GBC remains largely unexplored, representing a significant knowledge gap and innovation opportunity.

Our preliminary investigations have identified distinct radiographic patterns in GBC patients that correlate with specific molecular signatures. Building upon our institutional expertise in AI-driven medical imaging and cancer genomics, we propose to develop and validate a comprehensive radiogenomic platform for GBC that can:

- Non-invasively predict targetable gene mutations
- Guide precision therapeutic strategies
- Monitor treatment response dynamically
- Improve patient stratification and outcomes

### Project Vision

This proposal outlines a transformative approach to GBC management through the development of an AI-driven radiogenomic platform that integrates advanced computational methods with multi-institutional clinical datasets. Our vision encompasses the creation of a clinically deployable system that can revolutionize GBC care by enabling:

1. **Precision Diagnosis**: Accurate prediction of molecular subtypes from routine CT imaging
2. **Therapeutic Guidance**: Identification of patients likely to benefit from targeted therapies
3. **Prognostic Stratification**: Enhanced risk assessment and survival prediction
4. **Treatment Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of therapeutic response

The successful completion of this project will establish a new standard of care for GBC patients, potentially improving survival outcomes while reducing healthcare costs through optimized treatment selection and monitoring strategies.

## 2. State of Art Review

### 2.1 Current Status and Significance

#### 2.1.1 Gallbladder Cancer: Current Clinical Landscape

Gallbladder cancer represents the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, with an estimated global incidence of 220,000 new cases annually (Bray et al., 2023). The disease exhibits remarkable geographic and demographic variations, with age-adjusted incidence rates ranging from 0.5 per 100,000 in developed countries to over 10 per 100,000 in specific high-risk populations, particularly in Northern India, Chile, and certain Native American communities (Rawla & Sunkara, 2021).

**Current Diagnostic Approaches:**

The standard diagnostic workup for GBC relies on a combination of imaging modalities, including:

1. **Ultrasound (US)**: Primary screening tool with sensitivity ranging from 70-90% for detecting gallbladder masses
2. **Computed Tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for staging with reported accuracy of 85-95% for T-staging and 75-85% for N-staging
3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Superior soft tissue contrast, particularly valuable for assessing bile duct involvement
4. **Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT)**: Enhanced detection of distant metastases with sensitivity of 78-92%

Despite these comprehensive imaging approaches, current methods primarily focus on morphological characteristics and fail to provide insights into the underlying molecular landscape driving tumor behavior.

**Treatment Paradigms and Limitations:**

Current treatment strategies for GBC are largely based on tumor staging and patient performance status:

- **Surgical Resection**: The only potentially curative treatment, applicable to approximately 20-30% of patients at presentation
- **Adjuvant Chemotherapy**: Standard regimens include gemcitabine-based combinations, with modest survival benefits
- **Palliative Care**: Advanced cases receive systemic chemotherapy with limited efficacy

The major limitation of current approaches is the lack of molecular stratification, resulting in uniform treatment protocols that fail to account for the substantial genomic diversity observed in GBC.

#### 2.1.2 Genomic Landscape of Gallbladder Cancer

Recent large-scale genomic studies have revealed the complex molecular architecture of GBC, identifying multiple targetable alterations:

**Key Genomic Alterations:**

1. **TP53 Mutations**: Found in 60-70% of GBC cases, associated with aggressive tumor behavior
2. **KRAS/NRAS Mutations**: Present in 40-50% of cases, potential targets for emerging RAS inhibitors
3. **PIK3CA Mutations**: Identified in 15-20% of cases, targetable with PI3K/AKT inhibitors
4. **ERBB2 (HER2) Amplification**: Observed in 8-15% of cases, responsive to trastuzumab-based therapies
5. **IDH1/IDH2 Mutations**: Present in 5-10% of cases, targetable with IDH inhibitors
6. **BRCA1/BRCA2 Mutations**: Found in 3-8% of cases, associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity

**Emerging Therapeutic Targets:**

Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of targeted therapies in molecularly selected GBC patients:

- **Pemigatinib**: FGFR2 inhibitor showing efficacy in cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions
- **Ivosidenib**: IDH1 inhibitor approved for IDH1-mutated cholangiocarcinoma
- **Trastuzumab**: Anti-HER2 therapy showing promise in HER2-positive biliary cancers

However, the implementation of precision oncology in GBC is hindered by:
- Limited tissue availability for comprehensive genomic profiling
- High cost and turnaround time of molecular testing
- Lack of standardized molecular classification systems

#### 2.1.3 Radiogenomics: Emerging Paradigm in Cancer Care

Radiogenomics has emerged as a transformative approach that bridges the gap between imaging and genomics, enabling non-invasive prediction of molecular characteristics from medical images. The field has demonstrated remarkable success across multiple cancer types:

**Lung Cancer Radiogenomics:**
- AI models achieving 75-85% accuracy in predicting EGFR mutations from CT scans
- Successful prediction of ALK rearrangements and ROS1 fusions
- Integration with treatment response prediction models

**Breast Cancer Applications:**
- MRI-based prediction of BRCA mutations with 70-80% accuracy

   - Deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms

3. **Validation Frameworks:**
   - Cross-validation methodologies
   - External validation cohorts
   - Multi-institutional validation studies

#### 2.1.4 Current Gaps in Gallbladder Cancer Radiogenomics

Despite the success of radiogenomics in other cancer types, its application in GBC remains largely unexplored. A comprehensive literature review reveals significant gaps:

**Limited Research Volume:**
- Only 12 published studies on GBC radiogenomics as of 2024
- Most studies focus on basic radiomics without genomic correlation
- Lack of large-scale validation studies

**Technical Limitations:**
- Small sample sizes (typically <100 patients)
- Single-institution studies limiting generalizability
- Limited genomic profiling scope
- Absence of standardized imaging protocols

**Clinical Translation Barriers:**
